<h1>diz mi bayo.</h1>

<p class="first">Hi, I'm Rachel Frenkel, a Junior at Tufts University, class of 2016. </p><br>

<p class="second">I'm originally from Washington,  D.C.</p> <br>

<p class="third">If I could have any miniaturized animal as a pet, I would have a miniature tiger. So much power in such a small form (very similar to myself, ya know). </p><br>

<p class="fourth">If I could have any superpower, it would be the power to teleport, so that I could travel all over the world without having to fly there. </p><br>

<p class="fifth">If I could only eat one food for the rest of my life, it would be either mint chocolate chip ice cream or really good oranges. </p><br>

<p class="sixth">I love anything to do with water, the general outdoors, travelling, coding, and food. </p>
